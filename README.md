# CSAlgorithms
A complete set of the basic Computer Science algorithms implemented in java by me. All algorithms have been tested, and checked by my professor.
Topics include:
    *Graph Algorithms
    *Search Algorithms
    *Huffman Codification
    *Greedy Algorithms
 I tried to use object oriented programming for most of the algorithms in the implementation. I write the algorithm in a class and test it with an instace of that object in another class.
